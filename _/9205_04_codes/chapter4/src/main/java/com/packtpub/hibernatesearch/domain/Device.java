 * A simple entity class representing a hardware device... with a name, a manufacturer name, and a collection of 
 * software apps supported on the device.
 * 
 * The @Entity annotation tells Hibernate to treat this class as an entity in its own right, with a lifecycle not
 * necessarily tied to any other entity class.  However, because this class is NOT annotated with @Indexed, Hibernate 
 * Search will not create a Lucene index just for it.  Any information indexed for this class will be stored in the 
 * Lucene index of a containing entity (i.e. App).

	 * 
	 *      Although the relationship between App and Device is bidirectional, App is intended to be the primary container
	 *      entity.  Here, the "mappedBy" element tells core Hibernate which App member variable (i.e. App.supportedDevices)
	 *      references this entity.
	 * 
	 *      The "fetch" and "cascade" elements are set the same as with App.supportedDevices, and for the same reasons.
	 *      See the source code comments in App.java for more detail.
	 * 
	 * Finally, the Hibernate Search @ContainedIn annotation serves as the counterpart to @IndexedEmbedded (applied 
	 * to App.supportedDevices).  This tells Hibernate Search to include information about contained devices in the 
	 * Lucene index for App.
