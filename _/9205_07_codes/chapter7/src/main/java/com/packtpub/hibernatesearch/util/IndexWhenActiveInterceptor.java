/**
 * This is an EntityIndexingInterceptor for the App entity, and is used for conditional indexing.  The 
 * interceptor is intended to prevent indexing of "inactive" software apps (i.e. App instances where the 
 * "active" member variable is set to "false").  
 * 
 * The @Indexed annotation on the App entity class registers this interceptor, and causes one of its methods 
 * to be invoked when something happens to an App instance at the core Hibernate level.  The relevant method 
 * then determines what should happen in the Lucene index at the Hibernate Search level.
 * 
 * NOTE: Conditional indexing is not completely reliable, because interceptors are ignored when Lucene is
 *       re-indexed manually.  This is a known issue, and may be corrected in future Hibernate Search versions.
 *       See Chapter 2 of the book for more detail.
